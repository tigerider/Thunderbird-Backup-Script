# Thunderbird-Backup-Script

A simple, home-cooked bash script to tar-zip and back up your Thunderbird directory in a Linux machine

In a typical Thunderbird installation under Linux the Thunderbird directory under home ( ~/.thunderbird/* ) includes the whole profile and messages. This is "hardcoded" in the script, change it as you wish...

INSTALLATION: bash, and Thunderbird, obviously. No guarantee to work under other shells.

USAGE: If you have bash, it can be run from CLI _while at the directory_ where you want to keep the archive
